Reviewed FINEID PIN role types and verification.

Raw input exists only in `UnvalidatedSecret`; consuming construction
validates once and reconstructs the non-clonable, zeroizing `Pin1` and
`Pin2` role types. `verify_pin1` and `verify_pin2` consume a validated
PIN through a crate-private path, pad it to the stored length, and ship
it only as a credential command, consumed exactly once; the slot is
fixed by the argument type. The counter-safe status probe reads the
retry state without spending a counter, and the retry-risk policy maps
the live counter to the safety floors different surfaces stop at.

Both citizen and organizational cards are supported.
`resolve_pin_reference_scheme` settles which credential numbering the card
uses with the counter-safe probe, and the `_with_scheme` entry points act
under an already-resolved numbering. The organizational card compares the
typed PIN at its own length under its own references, with no padding, and
a PIN longer than the organizational maximum is refused locally before any
command spends a retry.

`PinManageOps` adds the card-mutating chains: `change_pin1`/`change_pin2`
(CHANGE REFERENCE DATA) and `unblock_pin1`/`unblock_pin2` (RESET RETRY
COUNTER). Unblocking presents a `Puk` -- its own non-clonable,
zeroize-on-drop role type, which never authorises an operation and spends
its own counter. The citizen card unblocks in one command; the
organizational card verifies the PUK as its own object and then resets
with only the new PIN. A wrong current PIN or PUK is reported as a typed
outcome, not an error.

No verification, change, or unblock path is described as working against a
real card until it is observed on hardware with the retry counter checked.
The change and unblock chains are card-mutating and PUK-consuming -- and
exhausting the PUK is terminal -- so they were not run to exhaustion on
hardware; together with the organizational numbering, which no card was
available to exercise, they rest on the specification and the behaviour
reference.

Constants are traced to the

sections 3.5, 3.11, and 3.12, and S4-2) and ISO/IEC 7816-4 and -8. See the
