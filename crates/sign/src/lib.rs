//! Card-side signing and RSA decipher for FINEID.
//!
//! The card holds the private key and performs the private-key
//! operation; the host computes the digest and drives the MANAGE
//! SECURITY ENVIRONMENT / PERFORM SECURITY OPERATION choreography. The
//! shape follows the card family the session resolved (see
//! [`SignScheme`]): the citizen card loads the digest with PSO:HASH and
//! signs an empty PSO:CDS, while the organizational card carries the
//! digest inline in a single PSO:CDS and issues no PSO:HASH. Both
//! families set the digital-signature template for either key. The PIN
//! that gates the key must already be verified in the card session;
//! these commands carry no credential material and use the plain
//! transport path.
//!
//! The pre-hashed signing chains all fit the short-form command:
//! RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 over SHA-256 or SHA-384 and RSASSA-PSS over SHA-256
//! for the RSA keys, and ECDSA over P-384 with SHA-256 or SHA-384 for the
//! newer keys. PSS is a
//! card-native scheme -- the card applies the padding from the digest, so
//! the choreography is the pre-hashed chain with a different algorithm
//! reference, not a host-encoded block.
//!
//! RSA decipher is the other private-key operation here: `decipher_rsa`
//! sets the confidentiality template and ships the modulus-wide cryptogram
//! by command chaining (its data field exceeds the short form), and the
//! card returns the recovered plaintext.
